        <p>Here are some of the projects I have worked on:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <h2>Project 1: Suicide Prevention Through Analysis of Suicide Factors</h2>
                <p>This project analyzes global suicide rates using WHO and UNDP data. 
                    Key factors such as age, gender, and education influence suicide rates, with older individuals and males being most at risk. 
                    Machine learning models, like Random Forest, were used to predict suicide rates, achieving 81.59% accuracy. 
                    The findings highlight the need for targeted mental health interventions in high-risk regions.</p>

                <h2> Project 2: League of Legends Game Result Prediction (Machine Learning) </h2>
                <p> This project aimed to predict the outcome of League of Legends matches using machine learning models. 
                    The data was sourced from Riot API and includes the first 15 minutes of gameplay from over 24,000 solo queue matches on European servers. 
                    The dataset features 28 variables, including kills, gold, and objectives like dragon kills, with the target variable being whether the blue team wins.</p>

                <h2>Project 3: Bookkeeping Mobile App (Java) </h2>
                <p> This is a bookkeeping mobile app designed to help users track and manage their daily expenses. 
                    Written in Java, the app offers a user-friendly interface and provides detailed financial insights.</p>
